# TransPauli

This is a simple Python script to track the evolution of
Pauli operators under the action of unitaries in the Clifford
group.

The unitaries are specified using a format similar to QASM, with 
a few minor differences.

The Python script has no dependencies outside of modules included 
in the default Python distribution.

# Suggestion

This script has not been updated or tested in a long time. More complete functionality can be found in the Julia packages Clifford.jl and GateTwirl.jl.
